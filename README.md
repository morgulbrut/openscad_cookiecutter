# openscad_cookiecutter

## Disclaimer

Converts a simple svg outline into a cookiecutter, since OpenSCAD doesn't support every SVG feature and the code is as KISS as possible, don't go too fancy. But cookiecutter works better with simple shapes anyway.

## How to

1. Make a simple outline in a SVG editor of your choice (I used inkscape because reasons).
2. Save it as **input.svg** in the same directory as **cookiecutter.scad**.
3. Open **cookiecutter.scad**, render and export to whatever your slicer can handle.
4. Print it.
5. Make tasty cookies.
