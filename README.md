# openscad_cookiecutter

## Disclaimer

Converts a simple svg outline into a cookiecutter, since OpenSCAD doesn't support every SVG feature and the code is as KISS as possible, don't go too fancy. But cookiecutter works better with simple shapes anyway.

## How to

1. Make a simple outline in a SVG editor of your choice (I used inkscape because reasons).
2. Open **cookiecutter.scad**, set the path to the SVG in the customizer.
3. Render and export it to something your slicer can handle.
4. Print it.
5. Make tasty cookies.
